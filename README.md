**Q1. What is Web Development?**
Web Development refers to the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications. It includes everything related to a website such as its design, functionality, and database management.

Web development is mainly divided into three parts:

**Frontend** – The part of the website that users see and interact with on the screen.

**Backend** – The server-side logic that processes requests and manages data.

**Database** – The place where application data is stored and retrieved.

**Example:**
Login page and buttons → Frontend
Login verification logic → Backend
Saving user details → Database

Q2. Difference between Frontend and Backend (with examples)
           **Frontend**	                **Backend**
        Visible to the user	   Works behind the scenes
        Runs in the browser	   Runs on the server
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript	   Node.js, PHP, Python
        Focuses on UI/UX design	   Focuses on data processing

**Example:**
Designing the login form → Frontend
Checking username and password → Backend
