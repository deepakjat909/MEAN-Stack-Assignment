1. What is Web Development?
Web development refers to the process of building, creating, and maintaining websites or web applications that run over the internet. It includes everything from a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.

It mainly consists of two segments:

Client-side (Frontend): What the user sees.

Server-side (Backend): How the logic and database work behind the scenes.
