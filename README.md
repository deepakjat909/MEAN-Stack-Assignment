**Q1. What is Web Development?**
Web Development is the process of designing, building, and maintaining websites and web-based applications that run on the internet. It involves creating web pages that are visually attractive, functional, secure, and easy to use. Web development ensures that users can access information, submit data, and interact with applications through a web browser.

**Web development generally consists of three major components:**

**Frontend Development:**
This part focuses on the user interface and user experience. It includes everything that users see and interact with on their screen, such as layouts, buttons, forms, and navigation menus. Technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are commonly used.

**Backend Development:**
Backend development handles the server-side logic of a website. It processes user requests, performs calculations, applies business rules, and communicates with the database. Technologies such as Node.js, PHP, and Python are used for backend development.

**Database Management:**
The database is responsible for storing and managing application data such as user details, login credentials, and records. Databases ensure data can be stored securely and retrieved efficiently.

**Example:**
Login page and buttons → Frontend
Login verification logic → Backend
Saving user details → Database

Q2. Difference between Frontend and Backend (with examples)
           **Frontend**	                **Backend**
        Visible to the user	   Works behind the scenes
        Runs in the browser	   Runs on the server
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript	   Node.js, PHP, Python
        Focuses on UI/UX design	   Focuses on data processing

**Example:**
Designing the login form → Frontend
Checking username and password → Backend
